# MEDP 33100 - Midterm Project

## Description
- In this project I used HTML, CSS, and Javacript to create an interactive and visually appealing walkthrough of the planets in out solar system. 
- I was initially inspired by a little story a friend of mine recorded about the planets, where she personifies them. I thought it was really cute and its stuck with my so I was inspired to create my project where you could go and 
- I mainly used JavaScript to dynamically change the page and GSAP for the animations.
-I hope to continue to improve on it as I didn't have enough time to do everything I wanted to encorporate. I also really had fun making it.
