# MEDP 33100 - Midterm Project

https://isap630.github.io/medp331-midterm/

## Project Overview
- In this project I used HTML, CSS, and Javacript to create an interactive and visually appealing walkthrough of the planets in out solar system. 
- I was initially inspired by a little story a friend of mine recorded about the planets, where she personifies them. I thought it was really cute and its stuck with my so I was inspired to create my project arounf this concept. 
- I mainly used JavaScript to dynamically change the page and GSAP for the animations and make the process of going through the planets engaging. 
-I hope to continue to improve on it as I didn't have enough time to do everything I wanted to encorporate. I also really had fun making it.

## Figma Design
- Initially I wanted to create a horizontal scroll function where you are able to scroll through the planets and the middle one in focus would smoothly get bigger and it reached the center. Unfortunatly, I wasn't able to figure out how to do it so I settled for buttons as the main function. I wanted to keep the layout simple and not have much clutter for the purpose of aesthetics.

## Features
- I have a few animations in theis project. I have some fading CSS animations I used to go between the menu page and the gallery. I also used some transitions to hover over the planet.
- The background music is initially triggered by the click of the start button and theres a sparkle sound effect when you click the arrow buttons to navigate the planets.
- The User-triggered events in my project are mostly initiated by clicking and hovering
- It adapts the layout and font sizing when changing to mobile. I have one issue with the size of Saturn's Image when going into mobile that I have a fix.

## Techonologies Used
- HTML, CSS, but mostly Javascript.
- Used GSAP Library for animations
- Github Pages to Host, Figma for Designing Layout

## Credits
- Used Canva to generate AI Images of planets
- Google Fonts for Fonts
- Used freesound.org and app.soundstripe.com for background sounds and music
- Used chatGPT to figure out some parts of the code (Commented in code)

## Future Enhancements
- I hope to continue to update this project. Here are a few things I would like to improve/fix:
1. Create Parallax Effect when mouse moves to create a more visually appealing Background of the stars.
2. Add intro paragraph to intro screen to explain the purpose of the page before you start
3. Spaceship that follows your mouse around.
4. Add Scrolling effect to mobile site
5. Mute button for music
6. Transitions between all pages
7. Fix glitches during planet animations to caused by overclicking buttons too fast
